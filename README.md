# How to _properly_ look at the code

1. Click on the green button which says _Code_
2. Select _Download ZIP_
3. Open the zip and put the folder in a convenient directory

You can now look at the code and edit it via Visual Studio Code or Notepad ++ or you can just look at it via Jupyter.
# How to run it 
1. Windows button + R
2. In the text window type cmd and press enter
3. Type `pip numpy` and press enter (only for first time run).
3. Type `python` and a space _do not press enter yet!_
4. Drag and drop `main.py` file to the window in which you typed `python`.
5. Press enter!
This can take a while. It will give you a result in the end

# Problems running
If you encounter problems, this probably has to do with your Python version (either outdated _or_ 64-bit which does not support numpy).
